# Setting Up Development Environment

This guide will assist you in configuring your development environment to work with Node.js, Redis, Express, and Nodemon.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) is installed.
- Basic knowledge of using the command line interface (CLI).

## Installation

### 1. Install Node.js

Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

### 2. Install Redis

Visit the [Redis website](https://redis.io/download) and follow the instructions to download and install Redis for your operating system.

### 3. Install Nodemon

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to install Nodemon globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository using the `cd` command in your terminal:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install project dependencies using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Server

To start the server with Nodemon, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will launch your Node.js server using Nodemon, which automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected in your source code.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your development environment for working with Node.js, Redis, Express, and Nodemon. You can now start developing your project.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to refer to the project documentation or seek assistance from the project maintainers.
